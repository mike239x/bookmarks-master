Here is an idea: 

I got tired of sorting out my own bookmarks, and I don't really have a nice system for them. How about I write some deep learning code that will help me do that?

So, it will sort my bookmarks in some self made folders and tag them.

It may come with extra option for cleaning old bookmarks (this should definitely ask first, and also learn from the answers, so it will not ask twice about hte same thing).

Also an interesting idea is to get some statistics made out of it.



# requirements

following python libs need extra installation:
 - requests : for easy http requests
 - numpy : gotta go fast
 - scipy : for Science!
 - scikit-learn : Machine Learning
 - pandas : Data Analysis
